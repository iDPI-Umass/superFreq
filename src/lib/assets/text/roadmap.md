The following features are intended for this software. Some will come after the release of the 1.0. These are listed in rough order of priority:

- Improved metadata mapping for Now Playing posts and collections including but no limited to:
  - scripts to get metadata from Bandcamp, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, and YouTube links
  - scripts to submit metadata from those links as well as manually added metadata to MusicBrainz
  - richer interaction with radio show archives and DJ mixes
- Granular filtering for the Feed and Collections
- [GOBO](https://gobo.social/) compatibility
- Groups and relevant moderation tools
- Local scene pages that will display flyers for upcoming events
- Various fun [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/) integrations
