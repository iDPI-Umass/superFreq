By using Freq, you consent to any data you submit in the form of profile information, posts, collections, and so forth being stored in Freq's database in perperuity.

For the purposes of moderation, a complete record of your speech and activity on the site is maintained. This applies even to old versions of items you've edited as well as deleted items. Your fellow users' safety and the overall health of the Freq community depends on these records of your activity. This is standard practice for social media sites, although right now may be the first time you've been told as much in plain English.

There is no data tracked by Freq except what you explicitly submit. Be aware that we have made no attempt to disable third party tracking in the YouTube and Soundcloud embeds you post, but some browsers afford the ability to block those on all sites you vist.

Data you submit to Freq will not be sold. It may be used in the future for minimally intrusive, non-surveillant advertising ideally following the ["forgetful advertising"](https://yjolt.org/forgetful-advertising-imagining-more-responsible-digital-ad-system) model.

Metadata you submit to Freq will likely be donated to [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/About). In the future, other data of yours may be submitted to MusicBrainz's sister project [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/about/) project, but only with your express consent. We will ask you directly for that consent and it will be clear what we are specifically asking for.

If there are any changes to the above data standards, you will be given candid, plain English notice and the opportunity to disable your account if you do not agree to those new standards.
