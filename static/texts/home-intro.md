# Welcome to Freq

Freq is an experimental social media platform for music discovery, centering music community.

Right now, you can do three things with it:

- Make collections of arists, albums, tracks, and record labels
- Follow other user's collections
- Follow other users

There are lots of things you can do with this simple too. These are only suggestions, please get creative:

- Keep a list of music you want to listen to
- Make sense of the stacks in your college radio station
- Catalog every artist, album, or track you've played on your radio show
- Collect all of the albums that have come out in your local scene this year
- Document music in a subgenre, part of them world, or moment in time that you love

To see what we plan on adding to the platform, check out our road map.

Submit some feedback and tell us what you think.
